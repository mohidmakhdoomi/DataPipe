## PostgreSQL E-commerce Business Logic Implementation

### Customer Tier Analytics (Based on PostgreSQL Order History)

- **Gold Tier** (12% of customers): High-value customers with frequent purchases
- **Platinum Tier** (3% of customers): VIP customers with highest lifetime value

### E-commerce Conversion Funnel Analysis
The batch layer processes transactional data to calculate:
1. **Customer Metrics**: Lifetime value, purchase frequency, average order value
2. **Product Analytics**: Sales performance, inventory turnover, category analysis
3. **Order Analytics**: Conversion rates, fulfillment metrics, revenue trends
4. **Business KPIs**: Daily/monthly revenue, customer acquisition, retention rates

### Business KPIs and Metrics
- **Customer Lifetime Value** (CLV) calculated from orders and order_items
- **Average Order Value** (AOV) from order total_amount analysis
- **Revenue per Customer** segmented by customer tier
- **Product Performance** metrics from order_items and products joins

## Lambda Reconciliation Strategy

The reconciliation process ensures eventual consistency between speed and batch layers:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract comparable datasets from both layers
2. **ID Alignment**: Handle PostgreSQL integer ID alignment between ClickHouse and Snowflake
3. **Metric Comparison**: Compare customer metrics, order transactions, and business KPIs
4. **Discrepancy Analysis**: Identify and analyze data inconsistencies
5. **Alerting**: Notify data engineering team of significant discrepancies in e-commerce metrics
6. **Convergence Tracking**: Monitor time to consistency convergence

## Implementation Notes

- Each task should be completed and validated before proceeding to the next
- Resource monitoring should be continuous throughout implementation
- All Spark batch jobs should be optimized for large-scale data processing
- Snowflake warehouse sizing should be optimized for cost and performance
- dbt models should follow incremental processing patterns where appropriate
- Lambda reconciliation should handle PostgreSQL integer ID alignment and data type conversions
- All transformations should be thoroughly tested with realistic e-commerce data volumes
- Focus on PostgreSQL source table structures: users, products, orders, order_items
- Ensure CDC metadata fields (__op, __ts_ms, __source_ts_ms, __source_lsn) are preserved throughout pipeline

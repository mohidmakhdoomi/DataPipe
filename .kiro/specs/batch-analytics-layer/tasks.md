## Lambda Reconciliation Strategy

The reconciliation process ensures eventual consistency between speed and batch layers:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract comparable datasets from both layers
2. **UUID Conversion**: Handle ClickHouse UUID to Snowflake STRING conversion
3. **Metric Comparison**: Compare user sessions, transactions, and business KPIs
4. **Discrepancy Analysis**: Identify and analyze data inconsistencies
5. **Alerting**: Notify data engineering team of significant discrepancies
6. **Convergence Tracking**: Monitor time to consistency convergence

## Implementation Notes

- Each task should be completed and validated before proceeding to the next
- Resource monitoring should be continuous throughout implementation
- All Spark batch jobs should be optimized for large-scale data processing
- Snowflake warehouse sizing should be optimized for cost and performance
- dbt models should follow incremental processing patterns where appropriate
- Lambda reconciliation should handle edge cases and data type conversions
- All transformations should be thoroughly tested with realistic data volumes

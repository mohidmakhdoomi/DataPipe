# Batch Analytics Layer - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive batch analytics layer that processes data from AWS S3 using Apache Iceberg, Spark batch processing, and loads results into Snowflake for business intelligence. The system includes dbt transformations for creating business-ready data marts and ensures eventual consistency with the speed layer.

The pipeline will be designed for local development and deployment using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes (kind provisioner), while connecting to real cloud services (AWS S3 and Snowflake) for storage and data warehousing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Lake Processing with Iceberg

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to process data from S3 using Apache Iceberg table format, so that I can leverage ACID transactions and schema evolution for reliable batch processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing is required THEN Spark SHALL read data from S3 using Iceberg table format
2. WHEN data is processed THEN Iceberg SHALL provide ACID transaction capabilities
3. WHEN schemas evolve THEN Iceberg SHALL handle schema evolution without data rewrites
4. WHEN time travel is needed THEN Iceberg SHALL support snapshot isolation and rollback
5. WHEN data compaction is required THEN Iceberg SHALL optimize file layouts automatically

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Data Warehousing

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want processed data loaded into Snowflake with a 3-layer architecture, so that I can perform complex analytical queries and business intelligence reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loaded THEN Snowflake SHALL implement a 3-layer architecture (Raw, Staging, Marts)
2. WHEN raw data arrives THEN it SHALL be loaded into the Raw schema with metadata tracking
3. WHEN data cleaning is needed THEN the Staging schema SHALL provide validated and typed data
4. WHEN business analytics are required THEN the Marts schema SHALL provide business-ready data models
5. WHEN query performance is critical THEN tables SHALL use clustering keys for optimization

### Requirement 3: dbt Transformations and Business Logic

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want dbt transformations to create business-ready data marts, so that I can access clean, modeled data for reporting and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transformations are needed THEN dbt SHALL perform SQL-based transformations in Snowflake
2. WHEN business logic is applied THEN dbt SHALL implement user tier analytics and session management
3. WHEN data quality is required THEN dbt SHALL include comprehensive testing and validation
4. WHEN documentation is needed THEN dbt SHALL generate automated documentation and lineage
5. WHEN incremental updates are required THEN dbt SHALL support incremental model processing

### Requirement 4: Lambda Architecture Reconciliation

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want automated reconciliation between speed and batch layers, so that I can ensure eventual consistency and data accuracy across the Lambda Architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reconciliation is performed THEN the system SHALL compare ClickHouse and Snowflake data
2. WHEN data discrepancies are found THEN the system SHALL alert and provide detailed reports
3. WHEN UUID conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL handle ClickHouse UUID to Snowflake STRING conversion
4. WHEN consistency validation runs THEN it SHALL check user sessions and transaction data
5. WHEN reconciliation completes THEN the system SHALL document convergence status and timing

### Requirement 5: Local Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the batch layer locally using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes, so that I can develop and test batch processing without requiring full cloud infrastructure for all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL run on Docker Desktop for Windows
2. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use kind provisioner with Spark Operator
3. WHEN connecting to cloud services THEN the system SHALL connect to real AWS S3 and Snowflake instances
4. WHEN Spark batch jobs run THEN they SHALL execute on Kubernetes with proper resource allocation
5. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL require no more than 12GB RAM for operation

### Requirement 6: E-commerce Business Intelligence

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want comprehensive e-commerce analytics and KPIs, so that I can make data-driven decisions about customer behavior and business performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide user lifetime value analytics
2. WHEN conversion analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL calculate funnel conversion rates
3. WHEN user behavior is analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide tier-based behavioral analysis
4. WHEN product performance is measured THEN the system SHALL provide product analytics and recommendations
5. WHEN daily reporting is required THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive business KPI dashboards

### Requirement 7: Data Quality and Governance

**User Story:** As a data governance officer, I want comprehensive data quality checks and governance controls, so that I can ensure data accuracy and compliance in the batch layer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive data quality validation
2. WHEN business rules are violated THEN the system SHALL flag and report violations
3. WHEN referential integrity is checked THEN the system SHALL validate relationships between entities
4. WHEN data lineage is required THEN the system SHALL track data flow from source to marts
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all data transformations and access

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the batch layer to be performant and cost-effective, so that it can handle large datasets efficiently while managing resource costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN Spark SHALL optimize job execution with adaptive query execution
2. WHEN Snowflake warehouses are used THEN they SHALL auto-suspend to minimize costs
3. WHEN data volumes grow THEN the system SHALL scale processing resources appropriately
4. WHEN performance monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL track processing times and resource utilization
5. WHEN cost optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for resource efficiency

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Lambda Architecture data pipeline that incorporates multiple modern data technologies to provide both real-time analytics and comprehensive batch processing capabilities. The system will handle high-throughput data ingestion (20,000 events per second), support change data capture from transactional systems, and provide dual serving layers for different analytical use cases.

The pipeline will be designed for local development and deployment using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes (kind provisioner), while connecting to real cloud services (AWS S3 and Snowflake) for storage and data warehousing. The architecture prioritizes out-of-the-box solutions and industry-standard integration patterns to minimize custom development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Technology Data Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to integrate all specified data technologies (PostgreSQL, Kafka, AWS S3, Iceberg, Spark, dbt core, Snowflake, ClickHouse, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes) into a cohesive pipeline, so that I can leverage the strengths of each technology for different aspects of data processing.

9. WHEN workflow orchestration is needed THEN Airflow SHALL manage and schedule batch processing jobs
10. WHEN deployment is required THEN Docker and Kubernetes SHALL provide the containerization and orchestration platform

### Requirement 2: Lambda Architecture Implementation

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want to implement Lambda Architecture with distinct speed and batch layers, so that I can provide both low-latency approximate results and high-accuracy comprehensive analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the speed layer THEN the system SHALL process streaming data via Kafka → Spark Streaming → ClickHouse path
2. WHEN implementing the batch layer THEN the system SHALL process data via Kafka → S3/Iceberg → Spark → Snowflake → dbt path

4. WHEN data flows through both layers THEN the system SHALL ensure eventual consistency between speed and batch results
5. WHEN queries are made THEN users SHALL be able to access real-time data from ClickHouse and historical data from Snowflake
6. WHEN data reconciliation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to validate consistency between layers

### Requirement 3: High-Throughput Data Processing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pipeline to handle 20,000 events per second, so that it can support high-volume transactional systems and real-time analytics requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives data THEN Kafka SHALL handle ingestion of at least 20,000 events per second
2. WHEN Spark Streaming processes data THEN it SHALL maintain throughput of 20,000 events per second with proper resource allocation
3. WHEN ClickHouse receives data THEN it SHALL support insertion rates of at least 20,000 records per second
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain processing latency within acceptable bounds for real-time analytics
5. WHEN throughput monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on actual vs target throughput rates

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Data Processing Capabilities

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the pipeline to support batch processing, streaming processing, and change data capture, so that I can handle diverse data processing patterns and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing is required THEN Airflow SHALL orchestrate scheduled Spark jobs for large-scale data processing
2. WHEN streaming processing is needed THEN Spark Streaming SHALL provide near real-time data processing capabilities
3. WHEN change data capture is required THEN Debezium SHALL capture row-level changes from PostgreSQL and publish to Kafka
4. WHEN data arrives in different patterns THEN the system SHALL handle both event streams and batch data loads
5. WHEN processing different data types THEN the system SHALL support structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

### Requirement 5: Dual Analytics Capabilities

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want access to both real-time analytics and comprehensive business intelligence reporting, so that I can perform operational monitoring and strategic analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time analytics are needed THEN ClickHouse SHALL provide sub-second query response times for operational dashboards
2. WHEN business intelligence is required THEN Snowflake SHALL support complex analytical queries and reporting
3. WHEN data freshness is critical THEN the speed layer SHALL provide data that is seconds old
4. WHEN comprehensive analysis is needed THEN the batch layer SHALL provide complete, accurate historical data
5. WHEN reporting tools connect THEN both ClickHouse and Snowflake SHALL support standard BI tool integrations

### Requirement 6: Local Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire pipeline locally using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes, so that I can develop and test the system without requiring cloud infrastructure for all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL run on Docker Desktop for Windows
2. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use kind provisioner with containerd image store
3. WHEN services require persistence THEN PostgreSQL, Kafka, and ClickHouse SHALL use external storage/persistent volumes
4. WHEN connecting to cloud services THEN the system SHALL connect to real AWS S3 and Snowflake instances
5. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL require no more than 16GB RAM for full operation
6. WHEN Spark is deployed THEN it SHALL run on Kubernetes rather than standalone mode

### Requirement 7: Airflow DAG Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Airflow DAGs to be separated from the Airflow services Docker image but available when services are running, so that I can update and redeploy DAGs without restarting Airflow services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Airflow is deployed THEN DAG files SHALL NOT be included in the Airflow services Docker image
2. WHEN Airflow services are running THEN DAG files SHALL be available to the scheduler and webserver
3. WHEN DAGs are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically sync new DAG versions without service restart

5. WHEN DAG changes are pushed THEN they SHALL be available to Airflow within 2 minutes

### Requirement 8: Out-of-the-Box Solutions Priority

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want the pipeline to use out-of-the-box solutions and minimize custom coding, so that I can reduce development time, maintenance overhead, and technical risk.

5. WHEN custom code is required THEN it SHALL be limited to configuration and orchestration logic only

### Requirement 9: Security and Reliability

2. WHEN components fail THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and notifications
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging across all components
4. WHEN performance monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL track resource utilization and processing times

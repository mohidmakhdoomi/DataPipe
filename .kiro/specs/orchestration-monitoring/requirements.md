# Orchestration & Monitoring - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for orchestration and monitoring capabilities that coordinate the data pipeline components and provide comprehensive observability. The system includes Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, comprehensive monitoring and alerting, security controls, and operational procedures.

The pipeline will be designed for local development and deployment using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes (kind provisioner), with git-sync capabilities for DAG management and comprehensive monitoring across all pipeline components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workflow Orchestration with Airflow

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want Apache Airflow to orchestrate batch processing workflows, so that I can schedule and monitor complex data processing pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing is required THEN Airflow SHALL orchestrate Spark jobs and dbt transformations
2. WHEN workflows are scheduled THEN Airflow SHALL support cron-based and event-driven scheduling
3. WHEN dependencies exist THEN Airflow SHALL manage task dependencies and execution order
4. WHEN failures occur THEN Airflow SHALL implement retry logic and failure notifications
5. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN Airflow SHALL provide workflow execution visibility and logging

### Requirement 2: Git-sync DAG Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Airflow DAGs to be managed through git-sync, so that I can update and deploy DAGs without restarting Airflow services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Airflow is deployed THEN DAG files SHALL NOT be included in the Airflow services Docker image
2. WHEN Airflow services are running THEN DAG files SHALL be available through git-sync sidecar
3. WHEN DAGs are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically sync new versions without service restart
4. WHEN git changes are pushed THEN they SHALL be available to Airflow within 2 minutes
5. WHEN DAG synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL alert and provide error details

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring across all pipeline components, so that I can detect issues, monitor performance, and ensure system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide metrics for throughput, latency, and error rates across all components
2. WHEN components fail THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and notifications with appropriate severity
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and distributed tracing
4. WHEN performance monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL track resource utilization and processing times
5. WHEN dashboards are accessed THEN they SHALL provide real-time visibility into system health and performance

### Requirement 4: Alerting and Incident Management

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want intelligent alerting and incident management, so that I can respond quickly to issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical issues occur THEN the system SHALL generate immediate alerts with escalation procedures
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide early warning alerts before SLA violations
3. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert with specific error details
4. WHEN alert fatigue is a concern THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent alert grouping and suppression
5. WHEN incidents are resolved THEN the system SHALL provide post-incident analysis and recommendations

### Requirement 5: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security controls and access management, so that data and systems are protected according to security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL use Kubernetes Secrets or sealed-secrets
2. WHEN inter-service communication occurs THEN it SHALL use TLS encryption
3. WHEN access control is required THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access control (RBAC)
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all administrative actions and data access
5. WHEN network security is required THEN the system SHALL implement network policies for service isolation

### Requirement 6: Local Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run orchestration and monitoring locally using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes, so that I can develop and test operational procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL run on Docker Desktop for Windows
2. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use kind provisioner with proper RBAC configuration
3. WHEN monitoring is deployed THEN it SHALL include Prometheus, Grafana, and log aggregation
4. WHEN Airflow is running THEN it SHALL use Kubernetes executor for task execution
5. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL require no more than 8GB RAM for operation

### Requirement 7: Backup and Disaster Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated backup and disaster recovery procedures, so that I can ensure business continuity and data protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups are performed THEN the system SHALL automatically backup persistent data and configurations
2. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide documented recovery procedures
3. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL support point-in-time recovery
4. WHEN recovery testing is performed THEN procedures SHALL be validated regularly
5. WHEN cross-region replication is required THEN critical data SHALL be replicated for disaster recovery

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring and Capacity Planning

**User Story:** As a capacity planner, I want detailed performance monitoring and capacity planning capabilities, so that I can optimize resource utilization and plan for growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance is monitored THEN the system SHALL track resource utilization across all components
2. WHEN capacity planning is needed THEN the system SHALL provide growth projections and recommendations
3. WHEN bottlenecks are identified THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization recommendations
4. WHEN cost optimization is required THEN the system SHALL track and report resource costs
5. WHEN scaling decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL provide data-driven scaling recommendations

### Requirement 9: Data Pipeline Health Checks

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want comprehensive health checks across the entire data pipeline, so that I can ensure end-to-end data flow integrity and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL validate data flow from ingestion through to analytics layers
2. WHEN data freshness is critical THEN the system SHALL monitor and alert on data staleness
3. WHEN data quality degrades THEN health checks SHALL detect and report quality issues
4. WHEN pipeline performance degrades THEN health checks SHALL identify bottlenecks and performance issues
5. WHEN end-to-end validation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive pipeline validation reports

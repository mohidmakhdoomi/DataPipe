# Real-time Analytics Speed Layer - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a real-time analytics speed layer that processes streaming data from Kafka using Spark Streaming and stores results in ClickHouse for sub-second analytics. The system will handle high-throughput stream processing (10,000 events per second) and provide real-time insights for operational dashboards.

The pipeline will be designed for local development and deployment using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes (kind provisioner). The architecture prioritizes low-latency processing and real-time analytics capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Stream Processing

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to process streaming data from Kafka using Spark Streaming, so that I can provide real-time analytics and insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming data arrives THEN Spark Streaming SHALL consume from Kafka topics with micro-batching
2. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL maintain throughput of 10,000 events per second
3. WHEN micro-batches are processed THEN the system SHALL use 2-second windows for optimal latency
4. WHEN failures occur THEN Spark SHALL use checkpointing for fault tolerance
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN Spark SHALL support dynamic resource allocation

### Requirement 2: Sub-second Analytics Storage

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want processed data stored in ClickHouse for sub-second query response times, so that I can build real-time operational dashboards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processed data is ready THEN it SHALL be written to ClickHouse for real-time analytics
2. WHEN queries are executed THEN ClickHouse SHALL provide sub-second response times
3. WHEN data is inserted THEN ClickHouse SHALL support insertion rates of at least 10,000 records per second
4. WHEN analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL support complex aggregations and filtering
5. WHEN data freshness is critical THEN the speed layer SHALL provide data that is seconds old

### Requirement 3: E-commerce Event Processing

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to process e-commerce events with user tier analytics, so that I can track customer behavior and conversion funnels in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are processed THEN the system SHALL handle 9 e-commerce event types (PAGE_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW, SEARCH, ADD_TO_CART, PURCHASE, REMOVE_FROM_CART, CHECKOUT_START, LOGIN, LOGOUT)
2. WHEN user data is enriched THEN the system SHALL apply user tier logic (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
3. WHEN sessions are tracked THEN the system SHALL implement stateful session management with 30-minute timeouts
4. WHEN conversion analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL calculate real-time conversion funnels
5. WHEN business metrics are required THEN the system SHALL compute user tier analytics and behavioral tracking

### Requirement 4: Local Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the speed layer locally using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes, so that I can develop and test real-time processing without requiring full cloud infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL run on Docker Desktop for Windows
2. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use kind provisioner with Spark Operator
3. WHEN services require persistence THEN ClickHouse SHALL use persistent volumes
4. WHEN Spark is deployed THEN it SHALL run on Kubernetes rather than standalone mode
5. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL require no more than 9.5GB RAM for operation

### Requirement 5: Data Quality and Validation

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want comprehensive data quality validation and error handling, so that I can ensure data integrity in real-time processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are processed THEN the system SHALL validate against JSON schemas
2. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN it SHALL be routed to dead letter queues
3. WHEN data quality issues occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts
4. WHEN late-arriving events occur THEN the system SHALL handle them with appropriate watermarking
5. WHEN duplicate events are detected THEN the system SHALL implement deduplication logic

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the speed layer to be performant and scalable, so that it can handle varying load patterns and maintain consistent performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load increases THEN Spark SHALL automatically scale executors based on backpressure
2. WHEN ClickHouse receives data THEN it SHALL optimize for both write throughput and query performance
3. WHEN resource utilization is high THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and alerts
4. WHEN bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL identify and report performance issues
5. WHEN scaling decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL provide capacity planning metrics

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring of the speed layer, so that I can detect issues and ensure real-time processing health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide metrics for processing latency and throughput
2. WHEN Spark jobs fail THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and provide failure details
3. WHEN ClickHouse performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert on query response times
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and tracing
5. WHEN SLA violations occur THEN the system SHALL provide alerting and escalation procedures

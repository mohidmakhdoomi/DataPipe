# Data Ingestion Pipeline - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a data ingestion pipeline that captures changes from PostgreSQL databases and streams them through Apache Kafka to AWS S3 for archival. The system will handle high-throughput data ingestion (10,000 events per second) and support change data capture from transactional systems.

The pipeline will be designed for local development and deployment using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes (kind provisioner), while connecting to real AWS S3 for storage. The architecture prioritizes out-of-the-box solutions and industry-standard integration patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Change Data Capture Integration

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to capture row-level changes from PostgreSQL databases using Debezium, so that I can stream transactional data changes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline is deployed THEN PostgreSQL SHALL serve as the primary OLTP database and CDC source
2. WHEN data changes occur in PostgreSQL THEN Debezium SHALL capture row-level changes and publish to Kafka
3. WHEN CDC is configured THEN the system SHALL use logical replication without custom code
4. WHEN changes are captured THEN the system SHALL maintain data lineage and audit trails
5. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the system SHALL handle schema evolution gracefully

### Requirement 2: High-Throughput Event Streaming

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pipeline to handle 10,000 events per second, so that it can support high-volume transactional systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives data THEN Kafka SHALL handle ingestion of at least 10,000 events per second
2. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL maintain processing latency within acceptable bounds
3. WHEN throughput monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on actual vs target throughput rates
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN Kafka SHALL support horizontal scaling through partitioning
5. WHEN data flows THEN the system SHALL ensure message ordering within partitions

### Requirement 3: Reliable Data Archival

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want all streaming data reliably archived to AWS S3, so that I can ensure data durability and enable downstream batch processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flows through Kafka THEN S3 Sink connector SHALL archive all events to AWS S3
2. WHEN archiving data THEN the system SHALL use efficient formats (Parquet) for storage optimization
3. WHEN data is stored THEN S3 objects SHALL be partitioned by date and hour for efficient access
4. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
5. WHEN data is archived THEN the system SHALL maintain exactly-once delivery semantics

### Requirement 4: Local Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the ingestion pipeline locally using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes, so that I can develop and test without requiring full cloud infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL run on Docker Desktop for Windows
2. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use kind provisioner with containerd image store
3. WHEN services require persistence THEN PostgreSQL and Kafka SHALL use persistent volumes
4. WHEN connecting to cloud services THEN the system SHALL connect to real AWS S3 instances
5. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL require no more than 4GB RAM for operation

### Requirement 5: Schema Management and Evolution

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want robust schema management and evolution capabilities, so that I can handle changing data structures without breaking downstream consumers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schemas are defined THEN the system SHALL use Confluent Schema Registry
2. WHEN schemas evolve THEN the system SHALL maintain backward and forward compatibility
3. WHEN new schemas are registered THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility rules
4. WHEN schema violations occur THEN the system SHALL route invalid messages to dead letter queues
5. WHEN schemas change THEN downstream consumers SHALL continue to function without modification

### Requirement 6: Pipeline Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the ingestion pipeline to expose data-specific metrics, so that monitoring infrastructure can detect data quality issues and pipeline-specific problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data quality issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and emit data quality metrics
2. WHEN pipeline-specific errors occur THEN the system SHALL emit detailed error context for data operations

*Note: Infrastructure monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, system metrics, logging infrastructure) is provided by the orchestration-monitoring feature.*

### Requirement 7: Data Security and Reliability

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the pipeline to implement data-specific security controls and error handling, so that data is protected during ingestion, processing, and archival.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted to AWS S3 THEN connections SHALL use encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS)
2. WHEN data validation fails or processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL route invalid data to dead letter queues and implement retry mechanisms for data recovery
3. WHEN AWS services are accessed THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles for production or access keys for local development
4. WHEN CDC user credentials are managed THEN the system SHALL support rotation of PostgreSQL and Kafka Connect service account credentials

*Note: Infrastructure-level security (sealed-secrets, TLS encryption, network policies, system audit logging, RBAC) is provided by the orchestration-monitoring feature.*

# Data Ingestion Pipeline - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a data ingestion pipeline that captures changes from PostgreSQL databases and streams them through Apache Kafka to AWS S3 for archival. The system will handle high-throughput data ingestion (10,000 events per second) and support change data capture from transactional systems.

The pipeline will be designed for local development and deployment using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes (kind provisioner), while connecting to real AWS S3 for storage. The architecture prioritizes out-of-the-box solutions and industry-standard integration patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Change Data Capture Integration

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to capture row-level changes from PostgreSQL databases using Debezium, so that I can stream transactional data changes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline is deployed THEN PostgreSQL SHALL serve as the primary OLTP database and CDC source
2. WHEN data changes occur in PostgreSQL THEN Debezium SHALL capture row-level changes and publish to Kafka
3. WHEN CDC is configured THEN the system SHALL use logical replication without custom code
4. WHEN changes are captured THEN the system SHALL maintain data lineage and audit trails
5. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the system SHALL handle schema evolution gracefully

### Requirement 2: High-Throughput Event Streaming

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pipeline to handle 10,000 events per second, so that it can support high-volume transactional systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives data THEN Kafka SHALL handle ingestion of at least 10,000 events per second
2. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL maintain processing latency within acceptable bounds
3. WHEN throughput monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on actual vs target throughput rates
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN Kafka SHALL support horizontal scaling through partitioning
5. WHEN data flows THEN the system SHALL ensure message ordering within partitions

### Requirement 3: Reliable Data Archival

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want all streaming data reliably archived to AWS S3, so that I can ensure data durability and enable downstream batch processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flows through Kafka THEN S3 Sink connector SHALL archive all events to AWS S3
2. WHEN archiving data THEN the system SHALL use efficient formats (Parquet) for storage optimization
3. WHEN data is stored THEN S3 objects SHALL be partitioned by date and hour for efficient access
4. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
5. WHEN data is archived THEN the system SHALL maintain exactly-once delivery semantics

### Requirement 4: Local Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the ingestion pipeline locally using Docker Desktop on Windows with Kubernetes, so that I can develop and test without requiring full cloud infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL run on Docker Desktop for Windows
2. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use kind provisioner with containerd image store
3. WHEN services require persistence THEN PostgreSQL and Kafka SHALL use persistent volumes
4. WHEN connecting to cloud services THEN the system SHALL connect to real AWS S3 instances
5. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL require no more than 4GB RAM for operation

### Requirement 5: Schema Management and Evolution

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want robust schema management and evolution capabilities, so that I can handle changing data structures without breaking downstream consumers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schemas are defined THEN the system SHALL use Confluent Schema Registry
2. WHEN schemas evolve THEN the system SHALL maintain backward and forward compatibility
3. WHEN new schemas are registered THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility rules
4. WHEN schema violations occur THEN the system SHALL route invalid messages to dead letter queues
5. WHEN schemas change THEN downstream consumers SHALL continue to function without modification

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring of the ingestion pipeline, so that I can detect issues and ensure system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide metrics for throughput, latency, and error rates
2. WHEN components fail THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and notifications
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging
4. WHEN performance monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL track resource utilization
5. WHEN data quality issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and report anomalies

### Requirement 7: Security and Reliability

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the pipeline to implement proper security controls and error handling, so that data is protected and the system is resilient to failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL use Kubernetes Secrets
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN connections to AWS S3 SHALL use encrypted channels
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement dead letter queues and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles for AWS access
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all data access and modifications
